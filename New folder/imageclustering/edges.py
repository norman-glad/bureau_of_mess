The Canny edge detector was developed way back in 1986 by John F. Canny.
 And it’s still widely used today was one of the default edge detectors
 in image processing.
The Canny edge detection algorithm can be broken down into 5 steps:
Step 1: Smooth the image using a Gaussian filter to remove high frequency noise.
Step 2: Compute the gradient intensity representations of the image.
Step 3: Apply non-maximum suppression to remove “false” responses to to edge detection.
Step 4: Apply thresholding using a lower and upper boundary on the gradient values.
Step 5: Track edges using hysteresis by suppressing weak edges 
that are not connected to strong edges.
OpenCV implementation of the Canny edge detector: 
cv2.canny(image, lower, upper)
Where image  is the image that we want to detect edges in; 
and lower  and upper  are our integer thresholds for Step 4, respectively.
